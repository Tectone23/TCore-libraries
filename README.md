# TCore

TCore is the central platform we are developing for. This is a “virtual platform”, analogous to how the Java virtual machine allows apps to run cross-platform, the TCore provides a virtual environment to run app back-ends, services, networks and etc.

## TCore Libraries
Currently there are TCore libs in for 2 languages (js and dart), with a kotlin/java lib in the works

1. Dart-TCore
Dart-TCore is a library developed and maintained by Tectone23 (us, the the developers of TCore)

2. TCoreJS (or tcore.js)
TCoreJS is a js/ts library for TCore which is also developed by Tectone23.
