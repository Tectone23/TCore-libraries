# TCore

TCore is the central platform we are developing for. This is a “virtual platform”, analogous to how the Java virtual machine allows apps to run cross-platform, the TCore provides a virtual environment to run app back-ends, services, networks and etc.

## TCore Libraries
Currently there are TCore libs in for 2 languages (js and dart), with a kotlin/java lib in the works

### TCoreLib.Dart

### TCoreLib.JS (or tcore.js)
